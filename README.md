# School-District-Analysis
Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze data for a school district. We used data that included cost of funding and student grades. Our goal was to provide a report on the school district's overall performance. The practical application of this project goal is to use this analysis to determine improvements for the school district. 

Results

* How is the district summary affected?

	* Removing math & reading scores for Thomas High School 9th graders from the analysis has a minimal affect on the district summary. 

* How is the school summary affected?

	* Removing the Thomas High School 9th graders from the analysis has a great affect on the school summary. The average math and reading scores dropped approximately 20-30%.

* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

	* The original dataset had Thomas High School as the second top-performing school. The removal of the 9th graders from the analysis data set placed  as Thomas High School as the lowest performing school. 

* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the data?

	* The data implies that more than funding determines the average student scores. Grade level does not appear to be an influencing factor in math and reading scores. As demonstrated by the math and reading scores, the size of the school may be a factor in students' average scores and passing percentages. Large schools reported the lowest average scores and passing percentages. The difference between medium and small sized schools was relatively negligible. In addition to school size, school type also seems to be a factor that can positively or negatively influence the students' average scores and passing percentages. Charter schools typically had greater performance reported than district schools. The reason for this may be tied back to school size as Charter schools tend to be medium or small size schools.

Summary

Due to the inability to determine the effects of academic dishonestly, the ninth grade students from Thomas High School have had their scores remvoed from the results of this analysis. The result of this reduction in the data set is that the average scores and passing percentages was greatly reduced.  Updating the total student count to exclude the 9th graders from Thomas High School seemed to re-establish the academic standing of the school.
